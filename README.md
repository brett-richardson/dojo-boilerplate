# Dojo Boilerplate: A Starter Kit for Dojo Development

The Dojo Boilerplate is a set of files to help you rapidly get up and running
with the Dojo Toolkit. It illustrates some basic best practices when working
with Dojo. This is the branch for the new Dojo 1.7 loader and build systems,
which use AMD modules; there is also a [branch using the old synchronous
loader](https://github.com/rmurphey/dojo-boilerplate/tree/master), for use
with Dojo 1.6.

Huge thanks go out to [neonstalwart](https://github.com/neonstalwart) for his
original
[dojo-requirejs-template](https://github.com/neonstalwart/dojo-requirejs-template)
project. Though that repository is no longer maintained, it was instrumental in
providing guidance for earlier versions of the AMD branch.

## Quick Start

0. Clone the repository using `git clone --recursive`.
1. Develop your project in `src/` until it is amazing.
2. Run `util/build.sh`, which will create an awesome optimised build in `dist/`.
3. Upload `dist/` for millions of people the world over to enjoy.
4. Hapyness.

### Windows Users

If you have [msysgit](http://git-scm.com) installed, run Git Bash and verify
some dependencies by running the following commands:

    which java
    which node

If at least `java` is available, youâ€™re ready to go; `cd` to your project
directory and follow the Quick Start instructions above. If Java is missing,
you will need to install it. Node.js is optional, but will reward you with
much faster builds.

## A brief tour

* The starting point of the boilerplate is the file at `src/index.html`. This
  file is responsible for loading the Dojo loader and the application's base
  JavaScript file.
* The file `src/js/app/_base.js` is your application's base JavaScript file. In
  it, you can specify dependencies on other files, including files you create.
  You can also write application code, though the code you write in this
  particular file should be limited to bootstrapping functionality.
* The file `util/build.sh` takes your application files and builds them for
  production use using the Dojo build tool. It depends on the presence of the
  bootstrapping file at `src/js/app/_base.js`.
* The file `src/css/app.css` contains import statements to load the CSS for
  Dojo's Claro theme. _If you are not using Dijit widgets, you probably want to
  remove these imports!_
* The directory `src/js/dbp` contains tools you may find useful. These tools
  are a work in progress.
